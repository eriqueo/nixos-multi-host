# Multi-Agent AI Bible Documentation System - Implementation Plan

## üéØ Project Overview

**Goal**: Create an intelligent "Bible-Based Documentation System" where specialized documentation "bibles" are maintained through threshold-based AI rewriting, with efficient change accumulation between major updates.

**Problem Solved**: Current system updates documentation on every commit, leading to processing overhead and potential inconsistencies. New system will intelligently accumulate changes and trigger focused AI rewrites only when significant updates warrant it.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Concepts
- **Section Bibles**: 6-8 definitive documentation files covering major system areas
- **Change Accumulation**: Lightweight logging of changes between AI rewrites  
- **Threshold-Based Updates**: AI rewrites triggered when accumulated changes exceed defined thresholds
- **Cross-Bible Consistency**: Automated validation and synchronization across all bibles

### Integration with Existing System
- **Current**: Post-successful-build ‚Üí AI analysis ‚Üí Documentation update
- **New**: Post-successful-build ‚Üí Change logging ‚Üí (Threshold check) ‚Üí Focused AI bible rewrite
