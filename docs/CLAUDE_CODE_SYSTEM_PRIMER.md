## 🚀 **CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS**

### **Testing Configuration Changes**
```bash
# ALWAYS test before committing
sudo nixos-rebuild test --flake .#homeserver
```

### **Applying Changes (Preferred Method)**
```bash
# Use the custom grebuild function (handles git + rebuild)
grebuild "Description of changes made"
```

### **Manual Git + NixOS Rebuild**
```bash
# If grebuild is not available
sudo git add .
sudo git commit -m "Changes description"
sudo git push
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#hwc-server
```

## 🐋 Container Architecture

### **Container Runtime**: Podman (not Docker)
- All containers managed via `virtualisation.oci-containers`
- Network: Custom `media-network` for service communication
- GPU access: NVIDIA device passthrough configured

### **Key Services**
- **Media**: Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Prowlarr, Jellyfin
- **Downloads**: qBittorrent + SABnzbd via Gluetun VPN
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager
- **Surveillance**: Frigate + Home Assistant
- **Business**: Custom Python dashboards and metrics

## 🔐 Security & Secrets

### **SOPS Integration**
- Secrets encrypted with age keys
- Keys located in `/etc/nixos/secrets/keys/`
- **NEVER commit unencrypted secrets**

### **VPN Configuration**
- ProtonVPN credentials in SOPS secrets
- Download clients route through Gluetun container
- Tailscale for remote access

## 🔧 GPU Acceleration Status

### **NVIDIA Configuration**
- **Properly configured** for containers and native services
- **Frigate**: TensorRT object detection
- **Immich**: AI/ML photo processing
- **Jellyfin**: Hardware transcoding
- **Ollama**: CUDA acceleration

### **GPU Access Pattern**
```nix
nvidiaGpuOptions = [ 
  "--device=/dev/nvidia0:/dev/nvidia0:rwm"
  "--device=/dev/nvidiactl:/dev/nvidiactl:rwm" 
  # ... additional device access
];

nvidiaEnv = {
  NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES = "all";
  NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES = "compute,video,utility";
};
```

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL SAFETY WARNINGS**

### **What NOT to Do**
1. **NEVER use RandomNinjaAtk arr-scripts** - Known to cause data loss
2. **NEVER commit unencrypted secrets** to git
3. **NEVER use `rm -rf` commands** in scripts without extensive safety checks
4. **NEVER modify hardware-configuration.nix** unless necessary

### **Always Test First**
- Use `nixos-rebuild test` before `switch`
- Test container changes in isolation when possible
- Monitor logs after changes: `sudo journalctl -fu service-name`

## 📊 Monitoring & Debugging

### **Key Monitoring Endpoints**
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin123)
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
- **Services**: Check respective ports in service configs

### **Common Debug Commands**
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status podman-servicename.service

# View container logs
sudo podman logs containername

# Check GPU utilization
nvidia-smi

# Monitor storage usage
df -h /mnt/hot /mnt/media

# SABnzbd specific debugging
sudo podman exec -it gluetun netstat -tlnp | grep 808  # Check ports
curl -I http://192.168.1.13:8081                      # Test direct access
```
