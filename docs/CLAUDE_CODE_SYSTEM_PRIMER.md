grebuild "Description of changes made"
```

### **Manual Git + NixOS Rebuild**
```bash
# If grebuild is not available
sudo git add .
sudo git commit -m "Changes description"
sudo git push
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#hwc-server
```

### **GPU Access Pattern**
```nix
nvidiaGpuOptions = [ 
  "--device=/dev/nvidia0:/dev/nvidia0:rwm"
  "--device=/dev/nvidiactl:/dev/nvidiactl:rwm" 
  # ... additional device access
];

nvidiaEnv = {
  NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES = "all";
  NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES = "compute,video,utility";
};
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SAFETY WARNINGS**

### **What NOT to Do**
1. **NEVER use RandomNinjaAtk arr-scripts** - Known to cause data loss
2. **NEVER commit unencrypted secrets** to git
3. **NEVER use `rm -rf` commands** in scripts without extensive safety checks
4. **NEVER modify hardware-configuration.nix** unless necessary

### **Always Test First**
- Use `nixos-rebuild test` before `switch`
- Test container changes in isolation when possible
- Monitor logs after changes: `sudo journalctl -fu service-name`

## üìä Monitoring & Debugging

### **Key Monitoring Endpoints**
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin123)
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
- **Services**: Check respective ports in service configs

### **Common Debug Commands**
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status podman-servicename.service

# View container logs
sudo podman logs containername

# Check GPU utilization
nvidia-smi

# Monitor storage usage
df -h /mnt/hot /mnt/media

# SABnzbd specific debugging
sudo podman exec -it gluetun netstat -tlnp | grep 808  # Check ports
curl -I http://192.168.1.13:8081                      # Test direct access
```
