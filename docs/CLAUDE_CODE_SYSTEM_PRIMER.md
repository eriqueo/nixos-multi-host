## üöÄ **CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS**

### **Testing Configuration Changes**
```bash
# ALWAYS test before committing
sudo nixos-rebuild test --flake .#homeserver
```

### **Applying Changes (Preferred Method)**
```bash
# Use the custom grebuild function (handles git + rebuild)
grebuild "Description of changes made"
```

### **Manual Git + NixOS Rebuild**
```bash
# If grebuild is not available
sudo git add .
sudo git commit -m "Changes description"
sudo git push
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#hwc-server
```

## üêã Container Architecture

- **Downloads**: qBittorrent + SABnzbd via Gluetun VPN
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager
- **Surveillance**: Frigate + Home Assistant
- **Business**: Custom Python dashboards and metrics

## üîê Security & Secrets

### **SOPS Integration**
- Secrets encrypted with age keys
- Keys located in `/etc/nixos/secrets/keys/`
- **NEVER commit unencrypted secrets**

### **VPN Configuration**
- ProtonVPN credentials in SOPS secrets
- Download clients route through Gluetun container
- Tailscale for remote access

## üîß GPU Acceleration Status

### **NVIDIA Configuration**
- **Properly configured** for containers and native services
- **Frigate**: TensorRT object detection
- **Immich**: AI/ML photo processing
- **Jellyfin**: Hardware transcoding
- **Ollama**: CUDA acceleration

### **GPU Access Pattern**
```nix
nvidiaGpuOptions = [ 
  "--device=/dev/nvidia0:/dev/nvidia0:rwm"
  "--device=/dev/nvidiactl:/dev/nvidiactl:rwm" 
  # ... additional device access
];

nvidiaEnv = {
  NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES = "all";
  NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES = "compute,video,utility";
};
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SAFETY WARNINGS**

### **What NOT to Do**
1. **NEVER use RandomNinjaAtk arr-scripts** - Known to cause data loss
2. **NEVER commit unencrypted secrets** to git
3. **NEVER use `rm -rf` commands** in scripts without extensive safety checks
4. **NEVER modify hardware-configuration.nix** unless necessary

### **Always Test First**
- Use `nixos-rebuild test` before `switch`
- Test container changes in isolation when possible
- Monitor logs after changes: `sudo journalctl -fu service-name`

## üìä Monitoring & Debugging

### **Key Monitoring Endpoints**
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin123)
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
- **Services**: Check respective ports in service configs

### **Common Debug Commands**
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status podman-servicename.service

# View container logs
sudo podman logs containername

# Check GPU utilization
nvidia-smi

# Monitor storage usage
df -h /mnt/hot /mnt/media

# SABnzbd specific debugging
sudo podman exec -it gluetun netstat -tlnp | grep 808  # Check ports
curl -I http://192.168.1.13:8081                      # Test direct access
```

**Latest Commits** (Last 7 days):
- **41d2882f**: This commit updates the NixOS configuration to test the implementation of an artificial intelligence (AI) documentation system. The key changes include:

- Removing unnecessary code that installed Streamlit and its dependencies, as it is now included in the `ExecStart` command for running the application server.
- Simplifying the `ExecStart` command by removing the `--root-path` option, which is no longer necessary since the application server runs on port 8000.
- Updating the file system handling to use a single regex pattern (`/business*`) instead of two separate patterns (`/business/*` and `/dashboard/*`), reducing complexity and potential errors.

These changes likely solve issues related to unnecessary code installation, simplify the configuration, and improve overall system stability. The commit's focus on testing the AI documentation system implementation suggests that this update is part of a larger effort to integrate this feature into the NixOS system.

3. **Use `grebuild`** for all configuration changes
4. **Test changes incrementally** - small commits are safer
5. **Monitor system resources** after changes
6. **Document new configurations** in appropriate `/docs/` files

## üîó Quick Reference Links

- **Service Status**: `sudo systemctl status podman-*.service`
- **Container Status**: `sudo podman ps`
- **Storage Usage**: `df -h && du -sh /mnt/hot/*`
- **GPU Status**: `nvidia-smi`
- **Network Status**: `ip addr show tailscale0`

This system is designed for reliability and performance. When in doubt, prefer safer approaches over complex automation, and always test changes thoroughly before applying them permanently.
