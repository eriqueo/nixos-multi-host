# System Concepts and Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This document consolidates all conceptual information about the NixOS multi-host homelab setup, including system architecture, design decisions, and operational workflows.


## Recent Architectural Evolution (AI-Generated: 2025-08-05)

Upon analyzing the recent commits to the NixOS homeserver, it appears that there have been significant architectural changes focused on improving service orchestration and containerization. The implementation of a declarative AI documentation system has streamlined configuration management, with Caddy being integrated into the system through a custom configuration file (`hosts/server/modules/caddy-config.nix`). This change enables more efficient and automated deployment of services, aligning with NixOS's emphasis on declarative infrastructure management.

## System Architecture

### Hardware Foundation
**Primary Server**: hwc-server with NVIDIA Quadro P1000 (Pascal architecture)
- **GPU Capabilities**: CUDA compute capability 6.1, 4GB VRAM
- **Storage**: Two-tier architecture (SSD hot storage + HDD cold storage)
- **Network**: Tailscale mesh networking with local LAN access

### Service Containerization Strategy
**Container Runtime**: Podman with systemd integration
**Network Architecture**: Custom container networks with media-network for inter-service communication
**GPU Sharing**: Direct device access pattern with sophisticated container builders
**Resource Management**: Automatic memory/CPU limits and hot storage integration

### Core Service Categories
1. **Media Management**: *arr applications with buildMediaServiceContainer
2. **Media Streaming**: Jellyfin (native), Navidrome, Immich (native with GPU)
3. **Surveillance**: Frigate with TensorRT + Home Assistant integration
4. **AI/ML**: Ollama with CUDA acceleration
5. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive Prometheus + Grafana stack with GPU metrics
6. **Download Management**: qBittorrent + SABnzbd via buildDownloadContainer with VPN
7. **Business Intelligence**: Custom Python dashboards with GPU acceleration

## GPU Acceleration Framework

### Design Philosophy
**Consistent GPU Access**: All GPU-capable services use standardized device access patterns
**Resource Sharing**: Multiple services share GPU through proper isolation
**Architecture Optimization**: Pascal-specific configurations (FP16 disabled for TensorRT)

### GPU Device Access Pattern
```nix
nvidiaGpuOptions = [ 
  "--device=/dev/nvidia0:/dev/nvidia0:rwm"
  "--device=/dev/nvidiactl:/dev/nvidiactl:rwm" 
  "--device=/dev/nvidia-modeset:/dev/nvidia-modeset:rwm"
  "--device=/dev/nvidia-uvm:/dev/nvidia-uvm:rwm"
  "--device=/dev/nvidia-uvm-tools:/dev/nvidia-uvm-tools:rwm"
  "--device=/dev/dri:/dev/dri:rwm"
];
```

### Service GPU Utilization Matrix
| Service | GPU Usage | Primary Benefit |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Frigate | TensorRT object detection | Real-time video analysis |
| Immich | Face recognition, ML processing | Photo organization |
| Jellyfin | Hardware transcoding (NVENC/NVDEC) | Video streaming |
| Ollama | CUDA inference | Local AI processing |
| *arr apps | Thumbnail generation | Media preview |
| Download clients | Video processing | Preview generation |

### Pascal Architecture Considerations
- **TensorRT**: Requires `USE_FP16 = "false"` for model generation
- **Memory Management**: 4GB VRAM requires careful resource allocation
- **Codec Support**: H.264/H.265 encoding, limited AV1 support

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection Architecture
**Core Metrics**: Node Exporter for system metrics
**Container Metrics**: cAdvisor for container resource usage  
**GPU Metrics**: NVIDIA GPU Exporter for GPU utilization
**Application Metrics**: Custom exporters for media pipeline health
**Storage Metrics**: Custom scripts for hot/cold storage monitoring

### Alert Management Strategy
**Severity Levels**: Critical, Warning, Info
**Notification Channels**: Webhook-based alerting system
**Alert Groups**: System, Storage, GPU, Containers, Services

### Dashboard Organization
1. **System Overview**: CPU, memory, disk, network
2. **GPU Monitoring**: Utilization, temperature, memory usage
3. **Media Pipeline**: Download queues, processing status, storage tiers
4. **Service Health**: Container status, endpoint availability
5. **Storage Management**: Hot/cold tier usage, migration status

---

## Media Pipeline Architecture

### Two-Tier Storage Strategy
**Hot Storage** (`/mnt/hot`): SSD-based fast storage for:
- Active downloads and processing
- Cache and temporary files  
- Recent media access

**Cold Storage** (`/mnt/media`): HDD-based archival storage for:
- Organized media libraries
- Long-term retention
- Plex/Jellyfin media serving

### Download and Processing Workflow
1. **Download**: qBittorrent/SABnzbd â†’ Hot storage
2. **Processing**: *arr applications process and organize
3. **Migration**: Automated scripts move completed content to cold storage
4. **Cleanup**: Scheduled cleanup of temporary files and old downloads

### VPN Integration
**VPN Provider**: ProtonVPN via Gluetun container
**VPN Scope**: Download clients only (qBittorrent, SABnzbd)
**Security**: SOPS-encrypted credentials, container network isolation

---

## Security and Access Control

### Network Security
**Tailscale**: Mesh VPN for remote access
**Firewall**: Interface-specific rules (tailscale0, local LAN)
**Container Isolation**: Network segmentation between service groups

### Secrets Management
**SOPS**: Age-encrypted secrets for sensitive configuration
**Credential Scope**: VPN credentials, API keys, passwords
**Access Control**: File-level permissions and ownership

### Service Authentication
**Internal Services**: Basic authentication where required
**External Access**: Reverse proxy with authentication (planned)
**Container Security**: Non-privileged containers where possible

---

## Storage Tier Management

### Automated Migration Strategy
**Migration Triggers**: Completion status, age, storage thresholds
**Migration Process**: rsync with verification and cleanup
**Monitoring**: Storage usage alerts and capacity planning

### Cache Management
**GPU Cache**: Dedicated cache for GPU-accelerated services
**Application Cache**: Service-specific cache directories
**Cleanup Policies**: Time-based and size-based retention

### Backup Strategy
**Configuration**: Git-based NixOS configuration backup
**Media**: Cold storage acts as primary storage (no backup needed)
**Surveillance**: Event-based backup to cold storage
