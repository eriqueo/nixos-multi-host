  - Verify IP address 192.168.1.104 is reachable
  - Consider IP address change if needed

### Medium Priority (Next Sprint)

#### ðŸŸ¡ Configuration Optimization
- [ ] **Enable cobra_cam_4 detection**: Set `enabled: true` in detect section after fixing connectivity
- [ ] **Frigate performance tuning**: 
  - Add motion masks to reduce false detections
  - Configure detection zones for each camera
  - Optimize object filters (min_area, thresholds)

#### ðŸŸ¡ Monitoring Enhancement
- [ ] **Frigate dashboard**: Create Grafana dashboard for camera system metrics
- [ ] **GPU alerting**: Configure alerts for high GPU temperature and utilization
- [ ] **Storage monitoring**: Enhance hot/cold storage capacity alerts

#### ðŸŸ¡ Documentation
- [ ] **Update CLAUDE.md**: Add common operations and troubleshooting commands

#### ðŸŸ¢ Features and Enhancements
- [ ] **Home Assistant integration**: Complete Frigate MQTT integration setup
- [ ] **Notification system**: Configure camera motion detection alerts
- [ ] **Backup automation**: Implement surveillance recording backup to cold storage
- [ ] **Container healthchecks**: Add comprehensive health monitoring for all services
- [ ] **Performance monitoring**: Implement container resource usage tracking

#### ðŸŸ¢ Security Improvements
- [ ] **Reverse proxy**: Implement Nginx/Traefik for external service access
- [ ] **Certificate management**: Set up automatic SSL certificate management
- [ ] **Access control**: Implement authentication for external service access
- [ ] **Firewall hardening**: Review and optimize firewall rules

#### ðŸŸ¢ Infrastructure
- [ ] **Container registry**: Set up local container registry for custom images
- [ ] **Update automation**: Implement automated container image updates
- [ ] **Disaster recovery**: Document full system restore procedures
- [ ] **Hardware monitoring**: Add temperature sensors and fan control
